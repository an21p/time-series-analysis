% Calculates the generalized Hurst exponent H(q) from the scaling 
% of the renormalized q-moments of the distribution 
%
%       <|x(t+r)-x(t)|^q>/<x(t)^q> ~ r^[qH(q)]

% H = genhurst(S)
% S is 1xT data series (T>50 recommended)
% calculates H(q=1)
%
% H = GenHurst(S,q)
% specifies the exponent q which can be a vector (default value q=1)
%
% H = genhurst(S,q,maxT)
% specifies value maxT of the scaling window, default value maxT=19
%
% [H,sH]=GenHurst(S,...)
% estimates the standard deviation sH(q)
%
% example:
%   generalized Hurst exponent for a random gaussian process
%   H=genhurst(cumsum(randn(10000,1)))
% or 
%   H=genhurst(cumsum(randn(10000,1)),q) to calculate H(q) with arbitrary q
