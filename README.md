- Deviations from Random Walk (ACF, PACF)
- ARIMA Models, Forecasting

#### TODO:
##### Scaling Laws
- Stationarity
- Scaling/Multi-Scaling of return distribution
- Tail Exponent, Husrt Exponent
- Improve Models (Use t-student/kernel distribution to predict future log-returns)
- Validate Models

##### Dependancy and Causality
- Compute linear, non-linear and information-theoretic measures (validate using permutation tests)
- Look at consequences of above for portfolio selection
