# Time-Series Analysis

## Includes:
- Raw data used (10 cryptocurrencies)
### Scaling Laws
- Stationarity
- Deviations from Random Walk (ACF, PACF)
- ARIMA Models (Normal and t-student), Forecasting,Validate Models (Cross Validation)
- Correlation Coefficient Plot
- Fractals
- Tail Exponent
- Husrt Exponent
- Scaling/Multi-Scaling of return distribution

## TODO:
### Scaling Laws

##### Models
- Improve Models (predict future log-returns using GARCH) *

### Dependancy and Causality
- Compute linear, non-linear and information-theoretic measures (validate using permutation tests)
- Look at consequences of above for portfolio selection
